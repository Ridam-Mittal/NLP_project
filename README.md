Abstract
Matrix is an artificial intelligent web application with an aim of improving and easing the process of applying for a job. Some of the features include Resume Generator, Resume Analyzer, Cover Letter Sentiment Analyzer, Resume Image Analyzer among others. The designed software enables the user to create clean resumes, analyse the skills, search for the jobs and extract the skills from image-based resumes and carry out other graphical analysis. Matrix attempts to offer relevant information and advice to the people looking for employment through Machine Learning and Data Visualization.
Introduction
Job seeking include preparing resumes, preparing cover letters and searching for jobs that are appropriate to one’s calibre and experience. However, the technological enhancement has continued to be a barrier to many candidates to improve on their applications. Matrix provides solutions to these problems by integrating several tools in one and hence providing a solution. In this regard, Matrix provides the following services to users; resume generation, analysis and visualization to the user, and feedback and recommendations that are meant to boost the level of employability of the user and the efficiency of the job search. 


Proposed Work
The proposed web app, Matrix, includes the following key features:
1.Resume Generator: By completing blank form templates, the users of this application can prepare good resumes.
2.Resume Analyzer: It scans the resumes and looks at the competency to see the specific candidate for a certain position then searches for a place that the candidate can best fit.
3.Cover Letter Sentiment Analyzer: Refers to a user’s cover letter to determine whether the tone adopted is appropriate for a workplace.
4.Resume Image Analyzer: The resumes are also in image form where the author uses OCR to extract the text and represent the skills on maps and diagrams..

Methodologies
For implementation of Matrix, the following methodologies will be used:
1.Frontend Development
oFramework: React
oStyling: CSS/SCSS
oTools: Chart.js for data visualization and Heatmap.js for graphical reasoning.
2.Backend Development
oTech stack: python.
oLibraries: NumPy, pandas, re, Pytesseract etc.
3.Resume Analyzer
oNatural Language Processing (NLP): Used for the identification and categorization of skills from text resumes.
oLibraries used: for analysing the text there are tools such as spaCy, NLTK, Transformers and many others. 
4.Cover Letter Sentiment Analysis
oPre-trained sentiment analysis models using Hugging Face Transformers or Text Blob.
oOutput: Provides scores indicating whether the cover letter is positive, neutral, or negative.
5.Resume Image Analyzer
oOCR: Tesseract OCR for extracting text from image-based resumes.
oData Visualization: Create heatmaps using Matplotlib or Plotly for analyzing skill density.
6.Job Recommendation System
oContent-Based Filtering: Matches extracted skills from the resume with a database of job descriptions including required skills.
oMachine Learning: Uses ranking methods to recommend the best corresponding job position and other skills to be acquired.
Experimental Results

After implementing the application, the following results were observed:

1.Resume Generator offered properly formatted resumes that are suitable for most professional positions.
2.Resume Analyzer was able to identify and recommend core competencies and potential jobs depending on the inputs that was provided.
3.The audience of the Cover Letter Sentiment Analyzer got detailed sentiment indications that helped them adjust their messaging.
4.Resume Image Analyzer was also successful in identifying the contextual text from the image-based resumes and also offered useful visualizations.
5.Most of the tools such as heatmaps and bar graphs would enable the users to easily compare their skill levels and areas of weakness.
Conclusion
Matrix is an efficient and easy to use software solution for the complex problem with job applications. Using resume creation, assessment and visualization tools, Matrix assists candidates to know what can be done on their profiles and where they need to look for jobs. As such, the web app integrates through modern technologies efficient user experience for boosting employability and confidence in Pinnacle’s individuals.
Future Scope
1.	Integration with Job Portals: Integrate the Resume Analyzer to the user interface in such a way that the user can apply for jobs in jobsites like LinkedIn or Indeed from your tool.
2.	Multilingual Support: Allow creating documents in more languages in order to cater for international consumers.
3.	Mobile Application: Create an application called Matrix that has a mobile version.
4.	AI-Based Interview Preparation: Expand them, to mimic interviews and to provide effects with the responses of users.
5.	Gamification: Reward users for overall activity with special markers and badges, encouraging people to fill out their profiles and use the site more often.
